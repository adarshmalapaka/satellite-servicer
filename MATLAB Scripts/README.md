**Folder Name:** _MATLAB Scripts_

**_era_forward_kinematics.m_**: Runs forward kinematics for three known geometrically joint angles case.

**_era_inverse_kinematics.m_**: Runs inverse kinematics using fsolve and an iniial guess for the given end-effector X,Y,Z values.

**_era_workspace.m_**: Runs code to plot the workspace of the ERA robot assuming no obstacles

**_satellite_servicer_fk_ik.m_**: Runs forward and inverse kinematics on the above mentioned three known
